There are bunch of files.
Let me explain you briefly.

The main data exported from my Letterboxd account is watched.scv. I processed this data by using enhance_dataset.py
At the end the enhanced data is written to the extracted1.xlsx

Repeated the similar process for list.csv to make sure that user can search for some movies' correlation with my movie taste. This file is processed with List_to_be_compared.py and the outputs are directed to the list_to_be_compared_xlsx.
